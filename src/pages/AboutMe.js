                <p>Hello, my name is Nolan Song. I am a 3rd year Computer & Information Science major at the Ohio State University, expecting to graduate in May of 2023. Currently, I am looking for internship opportunities during the Summer 2022 season.</p>
                <p>I have been coding for 6-7 years now, constantly learning new environments and honing my problem solving skills. As far as recent experiences go, I have been focusing on developing my front-end skills but am open to opportunities in front-end, back-end, and full-stack.</p>
                <p>If you are looking for a natural leader, I'm probably not it. If I could describe my personality in three words it would be logical, empathetic, and docile. However, I am a quick learner, a great teammate, and always eager to contribute.</p>
                <p>During my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and reading fictional books/manga. Currently, the main game I play is Teamfight Tactics.</p>
